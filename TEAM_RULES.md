# 🤝 Teamwork Rules (Enhanced)

Our team aims to work efficiently and transparently by defining clear rules for **communication**, **decision-making**, and **conflict resolution**.  
We follow a lightweight, issue-driven workflow to keep collaboration smooth and focused.

---

## 💬 Communication

| Purpose | Tool / Practice | Frequency / Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Daily communication & feedback | **Discord** | Quick replies within 24 hours; mention teammates if a response is required. |
| Weekly progress sync | **Online Meeting (15–20 min, every Friday)** | Review progress, assign next tasks, resolve blockers. |
| Design & discussion | **GitLab Issues** | All major design or feature discussions happen here. Each issue must summarize conclusions. |
| Documentation & decisions | **README / TEAM_RULES.md / Issues** | These files serve as the single source of truth; no scattered notes or private messages. |

---

## 🧭 Decision-Making

We distinguish between **minor** and **major** decisions to stay efficient while maintaining transparency.

- ⚙️ **Minor decisions** (e.g., function naming, test cases): handled by the responsible member, documented in merge request.
- 🧩 **Major changes** (e.g., state transitions, command design, JSON format): require **two members’ approval** in a related GitLab issue.
- 🗓️ Major decisions are logged in the issue description or `README.md` for later reference.

---

## ⚔️ Conflict Handling

We handle disagreements constructively and objectively.

- 💬 Keep the discussion factual — focus on **code, data, and results**, not people.
- ⏱ If no agreement after **20 minutes**, switch to async mode:
  1. Each member writes short **pros/cons**.
  2. Quick vote → summarize at the top of the issue.
  3. Decision recorded by team lead.
- ❤️ Always assume good intent — the goal is a better project, not winning an argument.

## 🌈 Team Goals

> Build a **minimal yet extendable** Python project demonstrating:
> - Object-oriented design  
> - Finite state machines  
> - Clean CLI and codebase  
> - Issue-driven teamwork  
> - Extendable architecture for later project phases

---

## 🧩 How We Support Each Other

- 🤝 Each member reviews one other’s merge requests weekly.  
- 📋 Rotation rule: If one member is blocked, another temporarily assists within their module.  
- 📅 Friday meetings end with short “Show & Reflect” demos (progress review, lessons learned).  
- 🧠 Collective learning: code snippets, tips, and bugs are shared in a shared *Tips.md* file (optional later).
